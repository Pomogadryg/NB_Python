"""
Blackjack (twenty-one) is a casino game played with cards. The goal of the game is to draw
cards that total as close to 21 points as possible without going over. All face cards count as
10 points, aces count as 1 or 11, and all other cards count their numeric value.
The game is played against a bank. The player tries to get closer to 21 (without going over)
than the dealer. If the dealer busts (goes over 21), the player automatically wins (provided
the player had not already busted). The dealer must always take cards according to a fixed
set of rules. The dealer takes cards until he or she achieves a total of at least 17. If the dealerâ€™s
hand contains an ace, it will be counted as 11
